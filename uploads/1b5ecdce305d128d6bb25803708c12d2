Adding a custom order attribute

09/30/15

Ticket states:
1. Add custom attribute on the order object
        String, shiptoCountry
2. Create metadata for shiptoCountry
        1. Export all metadata from your sandbox
        2. Edit the XML to only include the order system object and the its attribute group
        3. Name the metadata "YYMMDD_shiptoCountry_O.xml"
        4. Import that back into your sandbox to verify the XML is properly formatted
3. Update eSW.XML pipeline in the CreateDWOrder pipeline
        1. Add from current session country
        2. Add to to Order.custom.shipToCountry
4. Test
        1.Run several tests on your sandbox from different countries and verify that the new custom attribute is appearing correctly in the order
        2. Export your tests and verify that the shiptoCountry is included and properly set
5. Code Review
6. Commit code and metadata.

How to tackle: 

1. 

Administration -> Site Development -> System Object Definitions
Clicked on Order -> scroll to the bottom and click on new. Give ID and value type

2. 
Export metadata. Adiministration -> Site Development -> Import / Export 
Export all of the sandboxes metadata (top option). Edit the metadata xml file to just include the 
type extension (in this case, Order), custom attribute definition (shiptoCountry), and the grouping (all groups). 

3. 
In the pipeline, create an assign node after the order object is created. Assign the CurrentSession.custom.country ->
Order.custom.shiptoCountry 

4. 
Another way to check besides debugging. 
Check expressions in eclipse under window->show view-> expressions (while debugging)
Merchant Tools -> Ordering -> Orders
Click Find, get desired order number, click on the attributes tab and look for the group the
custom attribute is located in
